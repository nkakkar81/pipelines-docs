=== Procedure

. Login to your OpenShift Container Platform cluster with your login and password:
+
----
$ oc login -u <login> -p <password> https://openshift.example.com:6443
----

. Create a project for the sample application:
+
----
$ oc new-project pipelines-tutorial
----

. Run the following command to see the `pipeline` service account:
+
----
$ oc get serviceaccount pipeline
----

. In the OpenShift Web Console switch to the *Developer* perspective of the OpenShift Web Console.

. Select the `pipelines-tutorial` project from the *Project* drop-down menu. On the *Topology* view of the *Developer* perspective, you will be able to see the resources of your Pipeline. The deployment at this stage is not complete. The `Pipeline` you create in the next steps builds the simple application which has a frontend and a backend and completes the deployment.

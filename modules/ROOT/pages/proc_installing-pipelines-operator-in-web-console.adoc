. In the *Create Operator Subscription* screen, ensure that:

  * the *Installation Mode* selected is *All namespaces on the cluster (default)*, as the OpenShift Pipelines operator needs to watch for Tekton Custom Resources across all namespaces.
  * the *Approval Strategy* is *Automatic* so that future upgrades to the operator are handled automatically by the the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). If you select *Manual*; when a new version of the Operator is available, you will need to manually approve the OLM update request to update to the new version.

To upgrade from the 0.5.0 or below, link:https://openshift.github.io/pipelines-docs/docs/docs/proc_uninstalling-pipelines-operator.html[uninstall the operator] and then install it again.

[NOTE]
